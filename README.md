Concepts Covered: Initialization of ArrayLists using different constructors and understanding the difference between capacity and size.
Key Code: Using aList.size() to get the element count and new ArrayList(aList) to copy one list into another.
<br>
<br>

2. Topic: Iteration on ArrayList (Filtering & Loops)
Image: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Iteration on ArrayList" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fe1c5e2-a6fe-4c70-a6c0-cb23ee72bc4d" />
Concepts Covered: Moving data from command-line arguments into a List and iterating through them using multiple loop types.
Key Code: Implementing a for-each loop for simple printing and a standard for loop with .get(index) for indexed output.
<br>
<br>

3. Topic: Methods in ArrayList (Manipulation)
Image: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Methods in ArrayList (CRUD Operations)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5131c9ed-95f2-4f9e-a114-8f98946c30e1" />
Concepts Covered: Modifying the contents of a list dynamically.
Key Code: * .remove(index): To delete an element.
.set(index, element): To replace an existing value.
.add(index, element): To insert a value at a specific position.

<br>
<br>
4. Topic: ArrayList Basic Implementation
Image:<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="ArrayList Basic Iteration   Input" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0134b28-f198-41a0-9b00-ffb3ec6efe71" />
Concepts Covered: Basic input handling and generic List declaration.
Key Code: List<String> namesList = new ArrayList<String>(); and printing the entire list object directly.

<br>
<br>
5. Topic: Vector Class (Legacy Collection)
Image: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Vector Class in Java" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11a66610-1622-49eb-88bf-c12fe3bccacb" />
Concepts Covered: Using the thread-safe Vector class and accessing elements via an Iterator.
Key Code: Using .addElement() instead of .add() and traversing using itr.hasNext() and itr.next().

<br>
<br>
6. Topic: Stack Data Structure (LIFO)
Image: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Data Structure (LIFO)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4faf2b4d-5466-4e15-9934-f3f7b8734597" />
Concepts Covered: Implementation of the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
Key Code: .push() to add items to the top and .pop() to remove and return the topmost item in a while loop.

<br>
<br>
7. Topic: Set Interface (Unique Elements)
Image: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Understanding Set Interface (HashSet:LinkedHashSet)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/078e8a6b-6a7c-403b-b968-fd24ca5e18c8" />
Concepts Covered: Managing a collection of unique items where duplicates are not allowed.
Key Code: * .remove(Object): Returns a boolean indicating if the removal was successful.
.contains(Object): Checks for the existence of an item within the Set.

<br>
<br>

8. Topic: Understanding Map Interface (Key-Value Pairs)
Image: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Understanding Map Interface" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c28308bd-4078-4abe-a58f-bbebb09743c5" />

Concepts Covered: Storing and managing data in unique key-value pairs using the Map interface.
